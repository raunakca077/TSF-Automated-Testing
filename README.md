# TSF-Automated-Testing
This project is done by me as a Web Development  intern at The Spark Foundation. I have used Selenium and its components in building this project.

#Task :

◇ Learn selenium and basic selenium automation scripting.

◇ Start with Google Search and read tutorials. Watch videos to
learn about various aspects of testing using selenium.

◇ Use selenium to create a test case to test the website
thesparksfoundation.sg

◇ The test script should check of at least 5 pages and 10
elements in total.

◇ Each element could be e.g. if the Logo exists, the navigation
bar appears, the name on about us page is correct, etc.

# Technologies used :

# What is selenium and why it is used?

Selenium is a free (open-source) automated testing framework used to validate web applications across different browsers and platforms. You can use multiple programming languages like Java, C#, Python, etc to create Selenium Test Scripts. Testing done using the Selenium testing tool is usually referred to as Selenium Testing.

Primarily it is for automating web applications for testing purposes, but is certainly not limited to just that.
Boring web-based administration tasks can (and should) also be automated as well.
